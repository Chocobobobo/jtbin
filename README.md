# FPGA Clones of Arcade Games by Jose Tejada (@topapate)

This repository contains only binary files of my FPGA cores. Although I have
had some cores released through the MiSTer repository or the source code repository;
nowadays I only add new releases to this repository in binary form.

# Supported FPGA Systems

Currently there are three systems that I maintain: MiST, MiSTer and SiDi.

## MiST & SiDi
For these systems you can generate ROMs using batch files or the MRA-to-rom file converter.

## MiSTer

You can download the binaries files from the mister folder. But you can also adapt
your update script to grab files from this repository. The folder mister/update contains
the update script
